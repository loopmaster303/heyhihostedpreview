# 🙌 Say Hey Hi to AI

**Easy access to AI** — free, low-barrier, no data storage.  
No paywalls. No subscriptions. No hidden conditions.

With natural language you can access a large part of human knowledge and capabilities.  
AI can help you understand, learn, explore, build, and get creative.

> Important: AI is not a human being. Not a creative soul, not a doctor, not a lawyer, not a friend or family member. It’s a tool. A machine. Nothing more, nothing less.

## 🔌 Models & APIs (Beta)
This app integrates:
- **Pollinations API** for free, open, creative generative AI (text & image). Pollinations focuses on democratizing AI and lowering barriers for experimentation — a rare platform that doesn’t hide behind paywalls and supports rapid prototyping, artists, educators, hackers, and everyday people. Without Pollinations, this project would not exist in this form. ❤️
- **Premium models via Replicate**, where available (e.g. advanced image, audio, or video models).

All infrastructure and features are beta: no guarantees, no SLA, no perfect stability.  
Models may change, fail, or be replaced at any time.

## 👤 Development
This is a single-developer project — no corporate funding, no team, no VC.  
Just tinkering, learning, and building tools that stay accessible to everyone.  
Use it. Share it. Democratize AI.
